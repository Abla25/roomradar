      "description": "Double room in West Hampstead flat -1,200 PCM (bills not included) - available now Greetings! We recently moved into this stunning property in West Hampstead and are looking for a third person to join us on a long-term basis. About the property: -Light, recently refurbished first floor apartment with wooden floors on a peaceful (and rather grand) avenue in NW3. -Open plan living area which leads out onto a decently sized balcony overlooking a well maintained garden. -Relatively large, recently refurbished kitchen. -Two full bathrooms and a powder room, so no race for the loo. -Five minute walk to the Heath, 15 to West Hampstead shops, 20 to Hampstead village. About the room (pictured): - 1,200 PCM cold. Not yet sure how much bills will be since we just moved in, but split between three. -Light, double bedroom which overlooks the aforementioned well maintained garden, with built-in wardrobes which have space for drawers and hanging. -Currently unfurnished, but could furnish for the right person. About us: Karina: A 33 year old who loves to travel and explore London! Keeps herself busy going for walks or catching up with friends. Lydia: A 32 year old who enjoys drinking beer, cooking, skiing, running, watching the ruby, and playing her flute (a mythical event which only happens when noone is around). Celeste: Lydia's short sidekick, Celeste, is a long-haired miniature dachshund (pictured) whose hobbies are known to include kissing (much to Karina's distaste), and wagging her tail. Exceptionally loving and relaxed, she makes for exemplary company. YOU: We’re looking for a third flatmate (of any gender) who is friendly, clean and easygoing. In the ideal world, we would love to live with someone we could call a friend and occasionally share a laugh and a wine (or tea) with - although, we do appreciate that there will be times when you want to close your door on the world and watch Survivor.",
