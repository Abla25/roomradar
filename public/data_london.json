Key info is below, feel free to ask questions! Room: Queen-sized bed, shelves, wide chest of drawers, tall wardrobe. Flat: Second floor. Plenty of storage, bath/shower, washer/dryer, dishwasher, double-glazing throughout (heaven). Location: Residential road, 5 mins from shops and petrol station. Buses are everywhere, Crouch Hill (overground), Highgate or Archway (tube) are within 15 mins walk. Bills: ¬£175 per person, included within rent. Me: Media analyst and volunteer with a few charities. Love living close to good pubs and cafes, Parkland Walk and Highgate Woods. Out with my friends as much as possible, but also need time to recharge ü´† You: Working full-time, prefers socialising out and returning to a peaceful and tidy environment. Happy sharing space and ideally some meals together when it suits us - ideally vegetarian, but not a deal-breaker! Disclaimers: The flat's not suitable for WFH >1 day a week, or for bike storage - but there is a bike hangar 2 mins away (¬£100/year). Pets are sadly not a possibility either. Next Steps: Please get in touch to arrange a video call tour initially, then if we think we'd be a good fit we can arrange an in-person viewing. It would be great to know what matters to you in the home and what your schedule's like. I look forward to hearing from you if that all sounds good :)",

      "description": "Good Sized Double Room Available in Charming English Home in Streatham SW16 Hi, I‚Äôm Tess and I‚Äôm looking for a lovely new flatmate to share my vibrant home. The house is an old English-style property on a quiet, traditional street with friendly neighbours. It‚Äôs super close to shops (less than a 2 minute walk) and just a 12 minute walk to Streatham Common Station or a 12 minute drive to Colliers Wood. There are great bus links running through to and beyond Brixton, making it easy to get around. Plenty of street parking too. About the Room: A bright double room with a peaceful view over the neighbourhood (perfect sunsets!) my flatmate just moved out but she had a double bed, chest of drawers and a clothing rack, so you‚Äôll have a blank canvas to make it your own! Please note: the rest of the house has already been decorated, so I‚Äôm not looking to add any more furniture or items to the shared areas (besides the basics). About Me: I‚Äôm a 29 year old Aussie working a professional hybrid job. I live with my two senior cats who sleep all day, so you‚Äôll need to be comfortable around pets. I‚Äôm pretty chill. I enjoy a good book, love exploring different parts of London and occasionally head out for drinks with friends. I appreciate a bit of banter but also value a peaceful home environment. Looking for someone likeminded. Clean, respectful of shared spaces, up for the occasional flatmate night, but also happy doing their own thing. Rent and Bills: ¬£1170 - The monthly amount includes rent and all bills, including: water, electricity, internet and council tax. If this sounds like it could be your next home, feel free to reach out!",

We recently moved into this stunning property in West Hampstead and are looking for a third person to join us on a long-term basis. About the property: -Light, recently refurbished first floor apartment with wooden floors on a peaceful (and rather grand) avenue in NW3. -Open plan living area which leads out onto a decently sized balcony overlooking a well maintained garden. -Relatively large, recently refurbished kitchen. -Two full bathrooms and a powder room, so no race for the loo. -Five minute walk to the Heath, 15 to West Hampstead shops, 20 to Hampstead village. About the room (pictured): - 1,200 PCM cold. Not yet sure how much bills will be since we just moved in, but split between three. -Light, double bedroom which overlooks the aforementioned well maintained garden, with built-in wardrobes which have space for drawers and hanging. -Currently unfurnished, but could furnish for the right person. About us: Karina: A 33 year old who loves to travel and explore London! Keeps herself busy going for walks or catching up with friends. Lydia: A 32 year old who enjoys drinking beer, cooking, skiing, running, watching the ruby, and playing her flute (a mythical event which only happens when noone is around). Celeste: Lydia's short sidekick, Celeste, is a long-haired miniature dachshund (pictured) whose hobbies are known to include kissing (much to Karina's distaste), and wagging her tail. Exceptionally loving and relaxed, she makes for exemplary company. YOU: We‚Äôre looking for a third flatmate (of any gender) who is friendly, clean and easygoing. In the ideal world, we would love to live with someone we could call a friend and occasionally share a laugh and a wine (or tea) with - although, we do appreciate that there will be times when you want to close your door on the world and watch Survivor.",
