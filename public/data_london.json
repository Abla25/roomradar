      "description": "Good Sized Double Room Available in Charming English Home in Streatham SW16 Hi, I‚Äôm Tess and I‚Äôm looking for a lovely new flatmate to share my vibrant home. The house is an old English-style property on a quiet, traditional street with friendly neighbours. It‚Äôs super close to shops (less than a 2 minute walk) and just a 12 minute walk to Streatham Common Station or a 12 minute drive to Colliers Wood. There are great bus links running through to and beyond Brixton, making it easy to get around. Plenty of street parking too. About the Room: A bright double room with a peaceful view over the neighbourhood (perfect sunsets!) my flatmate just moved out but she had a double bed, chest of drawers and a clothing rack, so you‚Äôll have a blank canvas to make it your own! Please note: the rest of the house has already been decorated, so I‚Äôm not looking to add any more furniture or items to the shared areas (besides the basics). About Me: I‚Äôm a 29 year old Aussie working a professional hybrid job. I live with my two senior cats who sleep all day, so you‚Äôll need to be comfortable around pets. I‚Äôm pretty chill. I enjoy a good book, love exploring different parts of London and occasionally head out for drinks with friends. I appreciate a bit of banter but also value a peaceful home environment. Looking for someone likeminded. Clean, respectful of shared spaces, up for the occasional flatmate night, but also happy doing their own thing. Rent and Bills: ¬£1170 - The monthly amount includes rent and all bills, including: water, electricity, internet and council tax. If this sounds like it could be your next home, feel free to reach out!",

      "description": "Double room in West Hampstead flat -1,200 PCM (bills not included) - available now Greetings! We recently moved into this stunning property in West Hampstead and are looking for a third person to join us on a long-term basis. About the property: -Light, recently refurbished first floor apartment with wooden floors on a peaceful (and rather grand) avenue in NW3. -Open plan living area which leads out onto a decently sized balcony overlooking a well maintained garden. -Relatively large, recently refurbished kitchen. -Two full bathrooms and a powder room, so no race for the loo. -Five minute walk to the Heath, 15 to West Hampstead shops, 20 to Hampstead village. About the room (pictured): - 1,200 PCM cold. Not yet sure how much bills will be since we just moved in, but split between three. -Light, double bedroom which overlooks the aforementioned well maintained garden, with built-in wardrobes which have space for drawers and hanging. -Currently unfurnished, but could furnish for the right person. About us: Karina: A 33 year old who loves to travel and explore London! Keeps herself busy going for walks or catching up with friends. Lydia: A 32 year old who enjoys drinking beer, cooking, skiing, running, watching the ruby, and playing her flute (a mythical event which only happens when noone is around). Celeste: Lydia's short sidekick, Celeste, is a long-haired miniature dachshund (pictured) whose hobbies are known to include kissing (much to Karina's distaste), and wagging her tail. Exceptionally loving and relaxed, she makes for exemplary company. YOU: We‚Äôre looking for a third flatmate (of any gender) who is friendly, clean and easygoing. In the ideal world, we would love to live with someone we could call a friend and occasionally share a laugh and a wine (or tea) with - although, we do appreciate that there will be times when you want to close your door on the world and watch Survivor.",
