Hello! I'm looking for two new roommates to join a lovely house in Collier's Wood. I'm Jacob, 32, professional musician and I've been living here with my good mates who are sadly moving on. The house is in a fairly quiet street near Collier's Wood Station and has loads of supermarkets and shops nearby. You don't just get Aldi, you get Lidl too and even an M&S if you're feeling boujee. The Morden Hall park nearby a is stunner for walks. Because I've been living here with my friends I'm looking for people who are invested in a warm community vibe and who want to socialise. Looking for approx 18-40 age range. Inclusive of all races and genders/sexualities. I'm friendly and easy-going and respect the space without being uptight, and looking for similar. Please note - because for insurance purposes we need to prove a combined income of 80k, you may need a UK guarantor with a salary of around 30k.",

I’m flexible to move whenever the new person would like to move in but ideally by end of September/early October - Cleaner once every 3 weeks for all shared spaces, including this toilet - 12 month contract with break clause if you decide to move - 1 month deposit protected in DPS scheme - Dishwasher and Washing Machine/ Dryer in house - The agency will sort out the paperwork and I can handover the keys. They aren’t too stringent on checks compared to other places - MUST be a single professional and cannot accept couples, students, or tenants with pets NB: The 3rd picture with the dark green bedding is how my room currently looks now.

The flat is bright and sunny with wooden floors and two stories (living, kitchen and bathroom downstairs, both bedrooms upstairs with large windows, lots of natural light!) There’s a bath/shower with great water pressure… Very important …! And a ton of storage space. The areas so so nice, the flats a minute away from pubs and cafes and only a 5-10 min walk from Notting hill/Golborne Road. It’s also got great transport links including being a less than 10 min walk from Westbourne Grove station. It’s honestly such a beautiful flat/area and I’m so excited to find the right person to join me in my new home!! Available already for the right person 😊😊 If you’re interested send me a msg and we can chat more!! Shay (21, tech sales, Australian)",

The flat is very spacious with lots of storage, a large shared living area leading to an open-plan kitchen and dining area, which opens out into a large garden and patio. The room is accompanied by a private ensuite, in addition to the communal bathroom. Bills are not included and are roughly £100-120 each per month. The flat is a 12-minute walk from Highgate and Archway stations on the Northern line, and buses run along the nearby Archway Road. Within walking distance are several parks including Parkland Walk, Highgate Woods and Waterlow Park. Two small supermarkets are also nearby plus the shopping areas and pubs of Highgate, Archway and Crouch End. You will be living with Joss and myself, who are both professionals and the flat has plenty of space for socialising together. The flat is managed by a letting agent who will transfer your name onto the tenancy agreement. The fee is £50 which I am happy to split with the new tenant. You will then pay me for my part of the deposit. If this looks like this could be your home, please message me to arrange a viewing. The room is available for £1207 PCM.

This spacious property features two bedrooms and a large living room, which could easily be converted into a third bedroom if needed. There is one bathroom, a kitchen, and the master bedroom comes with a built-in wardrobe, with an additional wardrobe in the hallway. The smaller bedroom offers access to a private terrace through the window. The rent is £1700 per month, and tenants are responsible for all other bills (council tax, water, gas, and electricity). The property will be available from the 1st of October, and only applicants able to move in from that date will be considered. We are truly sad to leave, as this home is very comfortable and spacious, but due to personal circumstances we must move. Important requirements: All tenants must be in full-time employment, or if applying as a family, both parents must work. Housing benefits and pets are not accepted.",

      "description": "Private room for rent Hello 👋🏼 I've a sunny, cosy flat for a warm, friendly housemate. Available from 10th September (flexible), rent is £1,224 inc. bills. Key info is below, feel free to ask questions! Room: Queen-sized bed, shelves, wide chest of drawers, tall wardrobe. Flat: Second floor. Plenty of storage, bath/shower, washer/dryer, dishwasher, double-glazing throughout (heaven). Location: Residential road, 5 mins from shops and petrol station. Buses are everywhere, Crouch Hill (overground), Highgate or Archway (tube) are within 15 mins walk. Bills: £175 per person, included within rent. Me: Media analyst and volunteer with a few charities. Love living close to good pubs and cafes, Parkland Walk and Highgate Woods. Out with my friends as much as possible, but also need time to recharge 🫠 You: Working full-time, prefers socialising out and returning to a peaceful and tidy environment. Happy sharing space and ideally some meals together when it suits us - ideally vegetarian, but not a deal-breaker! Disclaimers: The flat's not suitable for WFH >1 day a week, or for bike storage - but there is a bike hangar 2 mins away (£100/year). Pets are sadly not a possibility either. Next Steps: Please get in touch to arrange a video call tour initially, then if we think we'd be a good fit we can arrange an in-person viewing. It would be great to know what matters to you in the home and what your schedule's like. I look forward to hearing from you if that all sounds good :)",

      "description": "Good Sized Double Room Available in Charming English Home in Streatham SW16 Hi, I’m Tess and I’m looking for a lovely new flatmate to share my vibrant home. The house is an old English-style property on a quiet, traditional street with friendly neighbours. It’s super close to shops (less than a 2 minute walk) and just a 12 minute walk to Streatham Common Station or a 12 minute drive to Colliers Wood. There are great bus links running through to and beyond Brixton, making it easy to get around. Plenty of street parking too. About the Room: A bright double room with a peaceful view over the neighbourhood (perfect sunsets!) my flatmate just moved out but she had a double bed, chest of drawers and a clothing rack, so you’ll have a blank canvas to make it your own! Please note: the rest of the house has already been decorated, so I’m not looking to add any more furniture or items to the shared areas (besides the basics). About Me: I’m a 29 year old Aussie working a professional hybrid job. I live with my two senior cats who sleep all day, so you’ll need to be comfortable around pets. I’m pretty chill. I enjoy a good book, love exploring different parts of London and occasionally head out for drinks with friends. I appreciate a bit of banter but also value a peaceful home environment. Looking for someone likeminded. Clean, respectful of shared spaces, up for the occasional flatmate night, but also happy doing their own thing. Rent and Bills: £1170 - The monthly amount includes rent and all bills, including: water, electricity, internet and council tax. If this sounds like it could be your next home, feel free to reach out!",

      "description": "Double room in West Hampstead flat -1,200 PCM (bills not included) - available now Greetings! We recently moved into this stunning property in West Hampstead and are looking for a third person to join us on a long-term basis. About the property: -Light, recently refurbished first floor apartment with wooden floors on a peaceful (and rather grand) avenue in NW3. -Open plan living area which leads out onto a decently sized balcony overlooking a well maintained garden. -Relatively large, recently refurbished kitchen. -Two full bathrooms and a powder room, so no race for the loo. -Five minute walk to the Heath, 15 to West Hampstead shops, 20 to Hampstead village. About the room (pictured): - 1,200 PCM cold. Not yet sure how much bills will be since we just moved in, but split between three. -Light, double bedroom which overlooks the aforementioned well maintained garden, with built-in wardrobes which have space for drawers and hanging. -Currently unfurnished, but could furnish for the right person. About us: Karina: A 33 year old who loves to travel and explore London! Keeps herself busy going for walks or catching up with friends. Lydia: A 32 year old who enjoys drinking beer, cooking, skiing, running, watching the ruby, and playing her flute (a mythical event which only happens when noone is around). Celeste: Lydia's short sidekick, Celeste, is a long-haired miniature dachshund (pictured) whose hobbies are known to include kissing (much to Karina's distaste), and wagging her tail. Exceptionally loving and relaxed, she makes for exemplary company. YOU: We’re looking for a third flatmate (of any gender) who is friendly, clean and easygoing. In the ideal world, we would love to live with someone we could call a friend and occasionally share a laugh and a wine (or tea) with - although, we do appreciate that there will be times when you want to close your door on the world and watch Survivor.",
